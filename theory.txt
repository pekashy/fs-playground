 /proc/[pid]/auxv (since 2.6.0)
              This contains the contents of the ELF interpreter information
              passed to the process at exec time.  The format is one
              unsigned long ID plus one unsigned long value for each entry.
              The last entry contains two zeros.  See also getauxval(3).

 The getauxval() function retrieves values from the auxiliary vector,
       a mechanism that the kernel's ELF binary loader uses to pass certain
       information to user space when a program is executed.

       Each entry in the auxiliary vector consists of a pair of values: a
       type that identifies what this entry represents, and a value for that
       type.  Given the argument type, getauxval() returns the corresponding
       value.

       The value returned for each type is given in the following list.  Not
       all type values are present on all architectures.

 auxv vector is an array of strucutes alike:
         typedef struct {

                        long a_type;

                        union {

                               long a_val;

                               void *a_ptr;

                               void (*a_fcn)();

                       } a_un;

        } auxv_t;
